# Product Overview

**Product Name:** LegalConnect

**Summary:**  
LegalConnect is a web-based platform designed to digitize core workflows between lawyers and clients. It allows users to discover verified legal professionals, book consultations, register and track legal cases, securely exchange case documentation, and manage all lawyer-client interactions in one place. For legal professionals, LegalConnect streamlines appointment handling, centralizes client engagement, and builds a verified digital presence to attract and retain clients.
