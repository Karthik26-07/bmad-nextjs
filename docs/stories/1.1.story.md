# Story: User Registration and Authentication

## Status: Approved

## Story

As a potential user (citizen or lawyer),
I want to create an account and verify my identity,
so that I can securely access the LegalConnect platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

1. User can register with email, password, full name, and phone number
2. Email verification is required to activate account
3. Password must meet security requirements (min 8 chars, mix of letters, numbers, special chars)
4. User must select role (citizen or lawyer) during registration
5. Lawyers must provide additional Bar Council ID during registration
6. Users receive email confirmation after successful registration

### Security Requirements:

7. Passwords are securely hashed using modern algorithms
8. JWT-based authentication token is issued after successful login
9. Session expires after 30 minutes of inactivity

### Integration Requirements:

10. Integration with NextAuth.js with MongoDB for user management
11. Integration with MongoDB GridFS for profile images
12. Access control policies are properly set up for user data access

### Technical Notes:

- Implementation uses Next.js App Router for authentication flow
- Follow existing project structure under app/auth/
- Use ShadCN components for consistent UI
- Implement proper error handling and validation

## Related Components:

- Database: users collection (MongoDB)
